# GitLab-GitHub Proxy (glghproxy) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dka23/gitlab-github-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dka23/gitlab-github-proxy)

Proxy to provide GitHub-like API on top of Gitlab. Especially designed to use the **JIRA DVCS connector** with Gitlab.

**VERY IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. The address of glghproxy on your network MUST be DNS resolvable AND routable from BOTH a) JIRA server, and b) end-user browsers.
2. Additionally, glghproxy MUST operate on tcp/80.

## Setup

### Step 1. Launch glghproxy using Maven and Spring boot from CLI

**NOTICE:** The default Spring listen port is tcp/8080,
so specifying it again as a java argument is redundant,
but makes the problem explicit.  
You can choose to setup a port forward in front of it,
or (not recommended) run the service as root so you can listen on tcp/80.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -DgitlabUrl="http://yourgitlabserver.yourcompany.com" -Dserver.port=8080
```

Alternatively, you can launch using Docker, and its resident service will proxy tcp/80 -> tcp/8080 for you:
```bash
docker build -t glghproxy .
docker run -p 80:8080 glghproxy
```

If you use docker-compose you can easily build and start services

```bash
# Edit docker-compose.yml and configure gitlabUrl for your environment
docker-compose build  # Build the image
docker-compose up -d  # Start services
```

For the hostname (ie. `glghproxy`) you'll need to add a DNS entry or a `/etc/hosts` override.
However the latter will only work if glghproxy, JIRA, and the browser are operating on the same machine.
That can be nice for testing, (e.g., with a locally installed [containerized] trial version of JIRA) but
be aware that if you are using docker containers you'll need to ensure the hostname resolves to an IP that
is resolvable from all sides--in that case, the `docker0` interface ip is recommended.

**WARNING:** By default, JIRA and glghproxy want to operate on the same tcp/8080 port. If you are not
using containers, you'll have to resolve this conflict yourself.

### Step 2. Generate new Application in GitLab

- Browse to your Gitlab Applications tab (`/profile/applications`)
- On the `Add New Application` tab, fill in the `Name` field with your choice (ie. `glghproxy`)
- Fill in the `Redirect URI` with the address you've chosen for this proxy service.

	```
	http://glghproxy/login/oauth/authorize_callback
	```
- Click the `Save application` button.
- Make note of the `Application Id` and `Secret` on the following page.


### Step 3. Add a new DVCS account in JIRA

- Browse to your JIRA Administration > DVCS accounts page (`/secure/admin/ConfigureDvcsOrganizations.jspa`)
- Click the `Link Bitbucket Cloud or Github account` button.
- On the `Add New Account` popup, select `Github Enterprise` from the `Host` dropdown menu.
- Fill in `Team or User Account` field with the name of the Gitlab group or username containing the repositories you want JIRA to integrate.  
  **NOTICE:** You will need to add multiple DVCS accounts if your repositories are spread across more than one group or username.
- Fill in `Host  URL` with the address you've chosen for this proxy service. (ie. `http://glghproxy`)	
- Fill in `Client ID` with the *Application Id* generated for you by Gitlab earlier.
- Fill in `Client Secret` with the *Secret* generated for you by Gitlab earlier.
- The `Auto Link New Repositories` and `Enable Smart Commits` checkboxes are compatible and are safe to configure to your liking.
- Click the `Add` button and then the `Continue` button when prompted.
- It should say `Connecting to Github Enterprise to configure your account...`.
- Then it should say `Linking new account ...`.
- Then you should see your newly added account listed and the JIRA DVCS feature should operate normally from here.
